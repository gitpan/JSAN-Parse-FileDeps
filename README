NAME
    JSAN::Parse::FileDeps - Parse file-level dependencies from JSAN modules

DESCRIPTION
    As in Perl, two types of dependencies exist in JSAN. Distribution-level
    install-time dependencies, and run-time file-level dependencies.

    Because JSAN modules aren't explicitly required to provide the
    file-level dependencies, this package was created to provide a single
    common module by which to determine what these dependencies are, so that
    all processes at all stages of the JSAN module lifecycle will have a
    common understanding of the dependencies that a file has, and provide
    certainty for the module developer.

METHODS
  library_deps $file
    The "library_deps" method finds a list of all the libary dependencies
    for a given file, where a library is specified in the form "Foo.Bar"
    (using the pseudo-namespaces common to JSAN).

    Returns a list of libraries, or throws an exception on error.

  file_deps $file
    The "library_deps" method finds a list of all the file dependencies for
    a given file, where a file is specified in the form "Foo/Bar.js" (that
    is, relative to the root of the lib path for the modules).

    The list is identical to, and is calculated from, the list of libraries
    returned by "library_deps".

    Returns a list of local filesytem relative paths, or throws an exception
    on error.

  find_deps_js $file
    The "find_deps_js" method is used to extract the header content from a
    file, to be searched for dependencies, and potentially written to a
    "module_deps.js" file.

    Returns the content as a list of lines, or throws an exception on error.

  make_deps_js $file
    The "make_deps_js" method takes a JSAN module filename in the form
    "foo/bar.js" and extracts the dependency header, writing it to
    "foo/bar_deps.js".

    Returns true on success, or throws an exception on error.
